# Electoral Bonds Analysis Project
### Overview
This project involves analyzing data related to electoral bonds in India. Electoral bonds are financial instruments aimed at improving transparency in political funding and reducing the influence of black money in elections. The analysis focuses on understanding donor behaviors, political party funding, and the overall impact of electoral bonds on political financing.
### What are Electoral Bonds?
Electoral bonds are financial instruments introduced in India to enable anonymous donations to political parties. Available for purchase at select State Bank of India (SBI) branches, these bonds come in denominations ranging from ₹1,000 to ₹1 crore and can be bought using cheques or digital payments. Launched in January 2018, electoral bonds aim to address the challenges of opaque political funding and unaccounted cash in elections.
### Objectives of Electoral Bonds
* Increase Transparency: Establish a regulated system for political donations to enhance transparency in funding.
* Reduce Black Money: Limit unaccounted cash contributions to promote cleaner money in politics.
* Encourage Donations: Simplify the donation process to encourage greater participation from individuals and companies.
### Business Case Problem
Political funding in India has long been marred by issues of opacity and unaccounted money. The introduction of electoral bonds aims to mitigate these challenges. However, it is crucial to analyze the effectiveness of this scheme in promoting transparency and understanding how funds are distributed among political parties.
### Purpose
The primary objective of this project is to analyze the data related to electoral bonds to:
* Evaluate the overall spending on bonds by donors.
* Understand the distribution of funds among political parties.
* Identify trends in political donations over the years and across different states.
* Provide insights that can help policymakers improve the electoral funding landscape.
